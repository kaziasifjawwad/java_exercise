## Instruction
run the `Test.java` file and trace the output .


> Do not compile or run the code. Trace yourself and try to identify if the code will throw a runtime error
> or a compiled time error.

> If none of the error occur, trace  the output.



_This exercise will help you to clear your concept of polimorphism in java. You will be able to
understand `runtime polimorphism` as well as `compiletime polimorphism`_
