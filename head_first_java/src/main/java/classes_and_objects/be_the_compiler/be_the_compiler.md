Each of the Java files on this page represents a complete source file. Your job is to play compiler and determine whether each of these files will compile. If they wonâ€™t compile, how would you fix them, and if they do compile, what would be their output?

```java
class StreamingSong {
    String title;
    String artist;
    int duration;
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing song");
    }
    void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("This is " + title +
                " by " + artist);
    }
}

class StreamingSongTestDrive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        song.artist = "The Beatles";
        song.title = "Come Together";
        song.play();
        song.printDetails();
    }
}
```
# `solution`
<br>
In the above code, we did not create any instance of StreamingSong class in StreamingSongTestDrive. However, we tried to access 
to artist using dot operation via a song object. However, the object was not created. The solution would be involve with creating object named 
song. Here is the fixd version of the above code.


```java
class StreamingSong {
    String title;
    String artist;
    int duration;
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing song");
    }
    void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("This is " + title +
                " by " + artist);
    }
}

class StreamingSongTestDrive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StreamingSong song = new StreamingSong();
        song.artist = "The Beatles";
        song.title = "Come Together";
        song.play();
        song.printDetails();
    }
}
```
Now the output reseult would be like this :<br>
`
Playing song
This is Come Together by The Beatles
`
