### Who am I ?
Tonight’s attendees:<br>
`instance variable`, `argument`, `return`, `getter`, `setter`, `encapsulation`,
`public`,
`private`, `pass by value`, `method`

* A class can have any number of `instance variable`
* A method can have only on of `return`
* This can be implicitly promoted 
* I prefer my instance variables private `encapsulation`
* It really means “make a copy." 
* Only setters should update these `instance variable`
* A method can have many of these `argument`
* I return something by definition `getter`
* I shouldn’t be used with instance variables  
* I can have many arguments `method`
* By definition, I take one argument `setter`
* These help create encapsulation `private` , `public` , `private`
* I always fly solo
