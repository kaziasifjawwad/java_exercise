## Be the compiler
Each of the Java files on this page represents a complete source file.
Your job is to play compiler and determine whether each of these files
will compile. If they wonâ€™t compile, how would you fix them, and if they
do compile, what would be their output?

## `A`
```java
class XCopy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int orig = 42;
        XCopy x = new XCopy();
        int y = x.go(orig);
        System.out.println(orig + " " + y);
    }

    int go(int arg) {
        arg = arg * 2;
        return arg;
    }
}
```
## `Solution`
> The above code contains one class named XCopy. This class also have a main method
> and additional one public method go [contains one parameter] . In the main method
> there is a variable named `orig` which is initialized with 42. and a variable
> named x contains one instance of this class `XCopy`. in variable `y` ,
> this instance of this class `x` called it's method go and passed parameter 
> `orig` . this will return return value `84` . The last line of the main 
> method will then print result : <br><br>**42 84**

## `B`
```java
class Clock {
    String time;

    void setTime(String t) {
        time = t;
    }

    void getTime() {
        return time;
    }
}

class ClockTestDrive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Clock c = new Clock();
        c.setTime("1245");
        String tod = c.getTime();
        System.out.println("time: " + tod);
    }
}
```
## `Solution`
> In the above code there are two class . `ClockTestDrive` class has a main function.
> In this main function a instance of class `Clock` was created and stored in variable
> `c` . In the second last line of this class, c was tried to call `getTime()` of
> `Clock` class. However, it tried to store a value in variable  `told`. On the
> other hand, getTime is a void method. So, it will not return anything. That's 
> why this code will throw a compiled time error.
